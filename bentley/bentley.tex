\chapter{The company}
\label{ch:company}

This chapter shed more light on the software I worked on during these six (6) months internship as well as the company. Actually I worked for Acute3D which had been acquired by Bentley Systems~\cite{acute} on February 10, 2015. Let us start with Bentley Systems.


\section{Bentley Systems}
Bentley Systems, Incorporated, is an American-based software development company founded by Keith A. Bentley and Barry J. Bentley in 1984. They introduced the commercial version of PseudoStation in 1985, which allowed users of Intergraph's VAX systems to use low-cost graphics terminals to view and modify the designs on their Intergraph IGDS (Interactive Graphics Design System) installations. Their first product was shown to potential users who were polled as to what they would be willing to pay for it. They averaged the answers, arriving at a price of
\$7,943. A DOS-based version of MicroStation was introduced in 1986. Later the two other brothers joined them in the business. Today, Bentley Systems is considered to have four (4) founders:
\begin{itemize}
\item Greg Bentley (CEO)
\item Keith A. Bentley (EVP, CTO)
\item Barry J. Bentley, Ph.D. (EVP)
\item Raymond B. Bentley (EVP)
\end{itemize}

At its core, Bentley Systems is a software development company that supports the professional needs of those responsible for creating and managing the world’s infrastructure, including roadways, bridges, airports, skyscrapers, industrial and power plants as well as utility networks.  Bentley delivers solutions for the entire lifecycle of the infrastructure asset, tailored to the needs of the various professions -- the engineers, architects, planners, contractors, fabricators, IT managers,
 operators and maintenance engineers -- who will work on and work with that asset over its lifetime. Comprised of integrated applications and services built on an open platform, each solution is designed to ensure that information flows between workflow processes and project team members to enable interoperability and collaboration.

Bentley’s commitment to their user community extends beyond delivering the most complete and integrated software -- it pairs their products with exceptional service and support. Access to technical support teams 24/7, a global professional services organization and continuous learning opportunities through product training, online seminars and academic programs define their commitment to current and future generations of infrastructure professionals.

With their broad product range, strong global presence, and pronounced emphasis on their commitment to their neighbors, Bentley is much more than a software company -- they are engaged functioning members of the global community. Their successes are determined by the skills, dedication, and involvement of extraordinary Bentley colleagues around the world.

Bentley has more than 3,500 colleagues in over 50 countries, and is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of \$700 million. Since 2012, Bentley has invested more than \$1 billion in research, development, and acquisitions.
